> inductive (intention) locking conditional state library

## Abstract

State-transitions which allow interesting operational dynamics. To achieve it, we try to split all conditions apart from the state-transitions that they guard. We name each independently and combine to form real functions.
The problem with such conditional paths within transition logic is that they add conceptual non-linearity over state semantics. Potential bugs hide when the programmer believes a conditional (and thus the state it projects onto) means one thing when in fact it means something subtly different.

- Function bodies should have no conditional paths.   
- Never mix transitions with conditions.   

Instead we rather abstract the condition and create a function modifier for this condition.    

Explicitly enumerate all such conditionals. Logic becomes flattened into non-conditional state-transactions.   

#### Base case
we show that there exists some state that is locked.       

#### Inductive case
Given an arbitrary locked starting state (our inductive hypothesis), we show that the state remains locked after transition.    

#### Assumptions
We assume that the user is not the contract itself.     

### Specification

We must precisely model reentrancy (i.e. interprocedural control flow) so that we can then formalize each of these state transitions as a guarded transition rule. 

Each rule takes the form:
  
$$ (state, parameters) | condition â†’ new_state $$


where 

`state` and `new_state` are state tuples     

`parameters` is a tuple of arguments for the transition     and 
`condition` is a predicate required for the transition to be valid.

These rules should hold for the following functions: `lockX`, `lockS`, `lockIX`, `lockIS`

## Data Model


#### Enum: `LockState`

This enum represents the possible states of the lock for a node.

| Value    | Description                                       |
|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| Unlocked | The node is not locked by any user.               |
| X        | The node is exclusively locked by a user.         |
| S        | The node is shared, allowing concurrent reads.    |
| IX       | Intention for exclusive access.                   |
| IS       | Intention to share.                               |



####  Struct: `Node`

This struct represents a node in the tree-like data structure.

| Field        | Type     | Description                                        |
|--------------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `state`      | LockState | The current state of the lock for this node.        |
| `owner`      | address  | The Ethereum address of the owner of the lock.      |
| `parentIndex`| uint     | The index of the parent node. 0 indicates root node.|


#### Array: `tree`

This dynamic array represents the tree-like structure, where each element is a `Node`. The index of an element in this array serves as its unique identifier.

| Index | Value |
|-------|-------|
| 0     | Root node of the tree (if it exists). |
| 1...n | Other nodes in the tree. The order of addition determines the index. |
